# SCHDEL (SCHEDULED FOR DELETION): (discussion and code for artificial gaps)
# It can happen that 2 pings can both occur since we last checked (a minute
# ago if using cron) which means that this script would notice them both *now*
# and ping you twice in a row with zero gap.  That's bad.
# This fixes that by checking if the next ping is overdue but not a
# retro-ping (ie, a *now* ping), in which case pause for the number of
# seconds between lstping and nxtping (but not more than retrothresh seconds).
# UPDATE: There were too many subtle corner cases with the above (like what
# if the computer was turned off (hibernating) while executing sleep()) so
# I got rid of it.  We're now counting on this script being run within a
# couple seconds of each ping else all pings within retrothresh will come up
# with zero gap.
    # if another ping is overdue, mind the gap! (ie delay the 2nd ping so as to
    #   maintain the original gap betw them (but not more than retrothresh)):
    #my $now = mytime();
    #my $eaten = $now - $prompt;  # subtract amount of time eaten up
    #                               #   answering last ping
    #if ($nxtping<$now && $nxtping>=$now-$retrothresh) {
    #  sleep(max(0, $nxtping - max($lstping,$now-$retrothresh) - $eaten));
    #}
