# Merge the tagtime logs given on the command line; output to stdout.
# If only one log file is given this just fills in any missing pings autotagged
# with MISSING and autotags pings that shouldn't be there with UNSCHED.
# NB: The rest of this is not fully implemented yet!
#     Currently just concatenates the tags from each log file.
#     Eventual spec follows, and in the meantime you can use it with a single
#     log file to just sanity check it...
# If multiple log files are given this will properly merge them, like if you
# use tagtime on multiple computers.
# Any ping that, according to the ping schedule, is missing from all the given
# logs will be added with the autotag MISSING and any pings present in any of
# the logs that shouldn't be there (again, according to the ping schedule) will
# have the autotag UNSCHED appended.
# For each outputted ping with timestamp t, include the union of the tags with
# timestamp t in all the given log files, ignoring log files that are tagged
# only with autotags at time t. Unless *all* the log files are tagged only with
# autotags at time t, in wich case go ahead and do the union like normal.
# Autotags are {MISSING, UNSCHED, RETRO, afk, off, err}.
# The earliest timestamp outputted is the earliest timestamp in all the logs.
# The latest timestamp outputted is the max of now and the latest in the logs.

# Notes: Collect every timestamp in every given log file, plus all the scheduled
# ping timestamps from the earliest one in the logs up to the max of now and the
# latest. Sort that whole collection and walk through it. For each t:
#   missflag = true
#   let @p = {}, a list of ping responses for each log file
#   for each log file l:
#     if tags{l+t} not empty: missflag = false
#     push(@p, tags{l+t})
#   if sch{t} and missflag: push(@p, "MISSING")
#   if not sch{t}: push(@p, "UNSCHED")
#   print t, join('+', @p)
